# Day 2 Assignment: Personal Expense Tracker
# In this assignment youâ€™ll be building your own Personal Expense Tracker based on what we covered in the Day 2 
# session of the Python Bootcamp. This command-line app will help you track daily expenses with the following features:
# Requirements:

# 1. Add Expenses with categories.
# 2. View All Expenses and calculate your total spending.
# 3. Save Expenses to a text file for record-keeping.

# Submission Instructions:

# 1. Ensure that your code is clean and well-commented.
# 2. Upload your project to a public GitHub repository.
# 3. Submit your GitHub repository link in the assignment submission section on CipherSchools.

# Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž

#this is a gemini model i have used it to make it interesting and as we know the world is dependent on AI and its a crucial technology to learn so why not yeah you can use your
#api key which is free interesting right!
#search GEMINI API KEY and generate your key and place it where i have written API_KEY  
#also if you dont want to try it you can just go with the read function it alsso works 
#Ai is just for fun 

#also i have not attached by API due to privacy reasons
